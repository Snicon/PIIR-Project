# PIIR Project

This is a passion project trying to enable me to communicate with my old (2011) LG TV through a Raspberry Pi and an
Express web server. Allowing me to make apps or other kinds of clients for controlling my tv along with other "dumb" 
IR remotely controlled hardware. 

## Not ready for production
This repo is in a very early state of development. I have yet to finish my concept device.

## How to run
